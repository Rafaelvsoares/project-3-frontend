# Project Description

Our group was assigned to work on a RESTful application project. For this project, we developed our own API using Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. The primary objective of the project was to create an e-commerce website that allows users to register, log in, and have their own shopping basket to purchase items. 

The website is named 'Kleur', which means 'colour' in Dutch. Users can purchase colours with paint names similar to those of Farrow & Ball and Dulux. Additionally, we included an interactive feature that allows users to select a custom colour and name it whatever they wish. The chosen colour is then displayed on a 3D cube rendered using react-three-fiber, a React library built on top of three.js for creating 3D graphics and animations. 

For the front-end, we used Material UI, React, TypeScript, and other libraries, such as react-three-fiber to render the 3D cube, axios for making HTTP requests to our API, and react-color for the colour picker component.

For the backend, we used Express, Node, TypeScript, MongoDB and used libraries such as bcrypt for password encryption, mongoose to interact with MongoDB and JWT for user authentication and authorization.
